This repository contains a SKILL for AI coding agents (like Claude Code, Cursor, or Windsurf) based on the Context Engineering methodology. It forces the AI to work in four strict, human-verified phases (Research, Design, Planning, Implementation) to generate secure, high-quality code while preventing LLM hallucinations and codebase degradation.
